# VSC-Trials
## My trials in setting Visual Studio Code for C++ learning 

The initial idea was to use VSC in Windows for C++ (re)learning, with as little as possible installations.
Of course this got out of control :-)

See my **gist(s)** at https://gist.github.com/Adrian-LL.

* [Part 1 - Windows 10, MSYS / MinGW](https://gist.github.com/Adrian-LL/3a7d676bacbcfdd9671d484cc86c5f76) 
  * The initial idea. I tried MinGW, settled for MSYS2.
* [Part 2 - Windows + WSL](https://gist.github.com/Adrian-LL/5a0380f3576a23829a4333081085766a)
  * I tried to use WSL tools (i.e. gcc / g++ and so on) with VSC in Windows
* [Part 3 - Installing VSC as graphical application under WSL, console and (unfortunate) conclusions](https://gist.github.com/Adrian-LL/d1feddc3db97a7b19af46b8aa934f39f)
  * Tried to install `code` inside WSL (actually not tried, but managed). Working with it is another story.
  * There are some considerations about using a better console and X Server
  * `sublime-text` works!
  
## Other things
### Good versions for Ubuntu:
* tasks.json
* launch.json

### Work In Progress:
* tasks for Clang++
* launch for lldb (somehat working)
